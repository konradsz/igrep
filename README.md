## Specifying text editor
`igrep` supports Vim, Neovim, nano, VS Code, Emacs and EmacsClient.
To specify the editor, use one of the following (listed in order of their precedence): 
- `--editor` option,
- `$IGREP_EDITOR` variable,
- `$EDITOR` variable.

Higher priority option overrides lower one. If neither of these options is set, vim is used as a default.
